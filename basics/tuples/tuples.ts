// Tuples
// These are like arrays, but the types of data in each position is fixed once initalized

let arr = ['black', 23, true]
// Tipically, we can reassign the value datatypes to a different datatype
// i.e arr[0] = 9

// now, with tuple, it can not be changed
let tup: [string, number, boolean] = ['james', 5, false]

// another eg:
let students: [string, number]
students = ['james', 3]
