## Step one(install typescript globally):
:- tsc sandbox.ts sandbox.js

## step two (convert typescript to javascript):
:- tsc sandbox.ts sandbox.js 

** Now, but since we share same ".js" & ".ts" fiilename, we use:
:- tsc sandbox.ts (this will automatically convert to js)

** Now, we don't need to run that code everytime a change is made, yes
so
:- tsc sandbox.ts -w


**## Now, down here, I am working with a workspace that contains public and src
where html, css, and javascript codes go into the public, while the typescript goes to src

## To run
: first initialize
:- tsc --init

: Then
:- tsc -w
